# Motor Vehicle Thefts Analysis in New Zealand - SQL Repository

## About This Repository

This repository contains the SQL queries used for analyzing motor vehicle thefts across New Zealand. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in vehicle thefts, including the **frequency of thefts over time**, **geographical hotspots**, and the **types of vehicles most commonly stolen**.
### Data Source

The data used for this analysis was sourced from Maven Analytics, and obtained through a paid subscription. This dataset includes detailed records of motor vehicle thefts across New Zealand covering the period from 2021 to 2022. Due to licensing restrictions and to respect the terms of service of Maven Analytics, the dataset itself is not included in this repository. For those interested in conducting a similar analysis or exploring the data further, I recommend visiting [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io) and considering a subscription to access their comprehensive datasets.
